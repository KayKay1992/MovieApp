HOME SCREEN UI


EXPLAINING THE SEARCH BAR COMPONENT.

Imports: The component imports icons, React, and React Native components (Image, StyleSheet, TextInput, View).

Interface (Props): Defines expected props: placeholder (string) and optional onPress (function).

Component: SearchBar is a functional component that accepts placeholder and onPress as props.

View: A container with flex-row styling, rounded corners, and dark background.

Search Icon: Displays a search icon (from constants/icons) with purple tint and fixed size.

TextInput: A text field with the passed placeholder, white text, and placeholder styling.

Event Handling: onPress triggers when the input is pressed, but onChangeText is empty (no logic).

Value: The input's value is hardcoded as empty (uncontrolled; likely needs state).

Styling: Uses Tailwind-like classes (via a library like nativewind) for styling instead of StyleSheet.

Export: The component is exported for use elsewhere, with an empty StyleSheet (unused).

WHAT HAPPENED AT INDEX.TSX

Imports: The component imports SearchBar, icons/images, navigation tools (Link, useRouter), and React Native components.

Background: A full-screen background image (images.bg) is set behind the content.

Scrollable Layout: A ScrollView ensures content fits on all screens (hides scrollbar, adds padding).

Logo: Displays a centered logo (icons.logo) with top/bottom margins.

SearchBar: Renders a search input that redirects to /search when pressed.

Navigation: Uses useRouter() to programmatically navigate on search bar press.

Styling: Applies Tailwind-like classes (flex-1, px-5, mt-20, etc.) for layout.

Unused Elements: Link and Text are imported but not used (likely for future features).

Responsive Design: The ScrollView dynamically adjusts height for different screens.

Purpose: A home screen with a search bar and logo, ready for movie search functionality.

TESTING: WHEN YOU CLICK ON SEARCH IT WILL NAVIGATE TO SEARCH PAGE.
