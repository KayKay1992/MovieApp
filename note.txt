Movie Details page

1. we create a function to get all the movie information
so in api.ts file we created that functionality and this is what it does

1. **Fetches movie data** from TMDB API using the movie ID  
2. **Sends GET request** with API key in the URL and required headers  
3. **Checks response status** - throws error if request fails  
4. **Returns JSON data** for the movie if successful  
5. **Catches/logs errors** and re-throws them for error handling  

We use this functionality at the dynamic route of the movie folder, [id].tsx to render our movie details page.

Here's the explanation in 15 concise lines:

1. Imports React Native components and hooks for navigation and data fetching  
2. Defines a reusable `MovieInfo` component for labeled movie data display  
3. Creates utility functions (`formatCurrency`, `formatRuntime`) for data formatting  
4. Fetches movie details using a custom hook (`useFetch`) with the movie ID from URL params  
5. Shows loading state while data is being fetched  
6. Displays movie poster image from TMDB API with responsive sizing  
7. Renders basic info: title, release year, runtime, and adult rating if applicable  
8. Shows star rating with vote count in a styled container  
9. Displays movie overview/plot summary  
10. Lists genres with bullet separators for clean formatting  
11. Shows original language in uppercase format  
12. Formats and displays budget/revenue in millions/billions  
13. Lists production companies and countries with bullet separators  
14. Includes movie status and optional homepage link

The component efficiently organizes movie data into logical sections with proper type handling and error states, using a scrollable layout for all content with a persistent back button.
