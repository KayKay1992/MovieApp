React Native Components.

Basic React Native component. (TouchableHighlight component)

changes made 

Added TouchableWithoutFeedback Button:
A new TouchableWithoutFeedback component was added to the button section, below the existing TouchableHighlight button.
It triggers an Alert with the title "WithoutFeedback Pressed" and message "You clicked the WithoutFeedback button!" when pressed.
The button is styled with noFeedbackButton (blue background, similar to button but with a different color).
Accessibility props (accessibilityLabel, accessibilityRole) were added for screen reader compatibility.
Wrapped Content in View:
Since TouchableWithoutFeedback doesn’t support a style prop directly, its child content (a Text component) is wrapped in a View to apply styles (noFeedbackButton).
Updated handlePress:
Modified handlePress to accept a buttonName parameter for reusable alerts across both buttons.
Updated Imports:
Added TouchableWithoutFeedback to the import statement from 'react-native'.
Retained Existing Structure:
The TouchableHighlight button, Alert, header, card, and footer sections remain unchanged.
The TouchableHighlight button retains its underlayColor="#e64a19" for highlight feedback.
Explanation of TouchableWithoutFeedback
What is TouchableWithoutFeedback?
Definition: TouchableWithoutFeedback is a React Native component that makes its child components touchable, allowing them to respond to user interactions like taps or long presses, but provides no visual feedback when pressed. It’s a minimal touchable wrapper for scenarios where you want to handle touch events without altering the appearance of the UI.
Purpose:
Adds touchable behavior to UI elements without built-in visual effects like opacity changes (TouchableOpacity) or background highlights (TouchableHighlight).
Useful for custom interactions where you control the visual feedback manually (e.g., via state changes, animations, or custom styling).
Ideal for cases where visual feedback is undesirable or needs to be precisely tailored.
How it Differs from TouchableHighlight and TouchableOpacity:
Feedback Mechanism:
TouchableOpacity: Reduces opacity (fades) when pressed, controlled by activeOpacity.
TouchableHighlight: Changes the background to underlayColor when pressed.
TouchableWithoutFeedback: Provides no visual feedback; the UI remains unchanged when pressed.
Use Cases:
Use TouchableOpacity for subtle fade effects (e.g., modern buttons).
Use TouchableHighlight for prominent background color changes (e.g., traditional buttons).
Use TouchableWithoutFeedback for custom feedback (e.g., triggering animations, sounds, or state changes) or when feedback is unnecessary (e.g., invisible tap areas).
Styling Limitation:
Unlike TouchableOpacity and TouchableHighlight, TouchableWithoutFeedback does not support a style prop directly. You must style its child components (e.g., a View or Text).
Performance: It’s the lightest touchable component since it avoids rendering visual feedback, but this comes at the cost of requiring manual feedback implementation for good UX.
Key Properties
onPress: Function called when the component is tapped.
onLongPress: Function triggered on a prolonged press.
disabled: A boolean to disable interaction (e.g., disabled={true}).
hitSlop: Expands the touchable area beyond the component’s bounds (e.g., hitSlop={{ top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 10, right: 10 }}).
Accessibility Props: Supports accessibilityLabel, accessibilityRole, etc., for screen reader compatibility.
No Visual Feedback Props: Unlike TouchableOpacity (activeOpacity) or TouchableHighlight (underlayColor), it has no props for built-in feedback.

Summary
TouchableWithoutFeedback:
A touchable wrapper with no built-in visual feedback, used for custom interactions or invisible tap areas.
Added to the code as a blue button that triggers an Alert without changing appearance when pressed.
Supports onPress, onLongPress, hitSlop, and accessibility props.
Requires manual feedback (e.g., state or animations) for good UX.
Comparison:
TouchableOpacity: Fades with activeOpacity.
TouchableHighlight: Highlights with underlayColor.
TouchableWithoutFeedback: No feedback, fully customizable.
Usage in Code: The "Press Me (No Feedback)" button uses TouchableWithoutFeedback with a styled View child, contrasting with the TouchableHighlight button’s visible feedback.
