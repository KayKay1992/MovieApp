React Native Components.

Routing and Navigation (Cutomizing the Tabs and icons)


1. Remove the asset in your project

2. we visited this link https://github.com/adrianhajdin/react-native-movie-app?tab=readme-ov-file#links and downloaded the asset, unzipped it and moved the 4 folder into our project.

3

4. Instead of styling each icon we created a tabIcon component and pass it in each of icon.
5. To make the icons reuseable we will use prop, we passed whatever will change as prop to other icons. e.g focused, icon and text.

5. we can then customise how all our icons look together, we can do that directly on the Tabs component not on individual screen by using screenOptions

general explanation
This React Native code defines a tab navigation layout using `expo-router`'s `Tabs` component, with customized tab icons and styling. Here's a concise explanation of how it customizes tabs and icons in 15 lines:

The `_layout` function sets up a bottom tab navigator with four screens: Home, Search, Saved, and Profile. Each tab is defined using `Tabs.Screen`, with options to hide the header (`headerShown: false`) and a custom `tabBarIcon` rendered by the `TabIcon` component. The `TabIcon` component takes `focused`, `icon`, and `title` props to conditionally render icons based on focus state. When a tab is focused, it displays an `ImageBackground` with a highlight image, the tab's icon (tinted black), and the tab title in a styled row. When unfocused, it shows only the icon (tinted gray) in a centered view. Icons are sourced from the `icons` constant (e.g., `icons.home`, `icons.search`). The `screenOptions` configure the tab bar's appearance, setting a dark background (`#0f0D23`), rounded corners, and absolute positioning with margins. The `tabBarItemStyle` ensures icons are centered, and `tabBarShowLabel: false` hides default labels, relying on the custom `TabIcon` for visuals. The empty `styles` object suggests styling is handled via Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `className="flex flex-row"`). This setup creates a visually consistent, modern tab bar with dynamic icon and text rendering based on focus state.
