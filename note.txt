FETCH AND DISPLAY MOVIES

discover/movie instead is deprecated so its not working so i used discover movie that got me to this route 
https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie in tmdb site to fetch all movies.

explainin the movie card component 

Hereâ€™s a 10-line explanation of the `MovieCard` component:

1. **Imports:** React Native UI components and routing helper `Link` from `expo-router` are imported along with a custom `icons` set.
2. **Props:** The component receives a `Movie` object with fields like `id`, `poster_path`, `title`, `vote_average`, and `release_date`.
3. **Linking:** The entire card is wrapped in a `Link` that navigates to the movie's detail page (`/movies/{id}`) when pressed.
4. **TouchableOpacity:** Makes the card pressable for better user interaction.
5. **Poster Image:** Displays the movie's poster; if not available, it shows a placeholder image.
6. **Title Text:** Shows the movie title, truncated after one line to avoid overflow.
7. **Rating Row:** Displays a star icon and a rating (vote average divided by 2 and rounded).
8. **Release Year:** Extracts and displays the year from the `release_date` field.
9. **Tailwind Classes:** Uses Tailwind-style class names (`className`) for styling via a utility like `nativewind`.
10. **Export:** The component is exported as default for use in other parts of the app.


Editted the tailwind.config file to include all components file.

I moved the app.json and replace it with app.config.js to enable me pass the key using process.env

i rconfigured my app.ts file 

Then i used my movieCard component in index.ts introducing flatlist component and prop parsing.
